        <H2>What is it</H2>
        <P>
          <i>"Bad Cards"</i> is a online game inspired to <b>Cards Against Humanity</b>
        </P>
        <H2>Rules</H2>
        <P>When the game starts, a player becomes the judge of the current round and the other players are dealt 10 cards.</P>
        <P>A black card is chosen.</P>
        <P>
          Each player answer the question filling in the blanks by each choosing the white cards. The Czar receives them face down until
          each player has completed his turn.
        </P>
        <P>The Card Czar then picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one point.</P>
        <P>After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone draws back up to 10 white cards.</P>
        <P>The part of speech of a white card is a noun or gerund, including both single words and phrase constructions.</P>
        <P>
          Black cards are either fill-in-the-blank statements or questions. Both white and black cards break these rules on rare occasions.
        </P>
